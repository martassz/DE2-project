### Abstract
This project focuses on creating a portable environmental data logger implemented on an Arduino UNO board using the toolchains provided by PlatformIO. The data logger displays the measured environmental data (temperature, humidity, barometric pressure and light) on a display. By pressing an encoder button, the data logger starts collecting the data to an SD card, which can then be visualised by a Python script on a computer. The data logger also has a red and green LED that blink upon runtime to indicate whether the environmental data in the room fall within optimal ranges of values (eg. humidity 35-70 %)
